Follow shortened links (t.co, bit.ly, etc) and expand them so that your blog post will point directly to the destination.

## Description

Automatically expands URLs at the following known link shorteners when you save a post:
t.co
bit.ly
ow.ly
j.mp
is.gd
trib.al
buff.ly
wp.me
tmblr.co
tinyurl.com
goo.gl
dlvr.it
fb.me
qr.ae

## Installation

Install the plugin and activate it. The next time you paste a supported short URL into a post, it will be updated when the post is saved.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if the destination redirects to another link?

It won't keep following the trail. Just in case there's a loop, or the destination page has been replaced with a redirection to a home page, etc.

But if the destination is another known shortener (say you had a t.co link that redirected to a bit.ly link), the next time you save the post, it will follow that one to its destination.
